## Requirements

This extension is currently only supported on Linux. The latest version of HHVM is required on the machine, and `hh_client` should be added to the $PATH. The workspace should have a `.hhconfig` file at its root.    

## Issues

Please file all bugs, issues, feature requests etc. at the [GitHub project issues page](https://github.com/PranayAgarwal/vscode-hack/issues).

*Current known issues:*

- The editor may not select the Hack language mode for `.php` files even if they start with ```<?hh```. To get around this, either manually select "Hack" as the file language from the selector on the bottom right of the screen, or configure your project workspace to open all `.php` files in Hack mode by adding the following to your workspace settings:

```json
    "files.associations": {
        "*.php": "hack"
    }
```
## Contributing

The project will be open to contributions once the inital release is feature complete and a beta version is launched in the Visual Studio Code extension gallery.
